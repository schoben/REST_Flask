* Fix the base of the assignment so it matches that of ex1
	- Option one
		- Go back to ex1
		- Fix the fixes we already did (the grader's feedback)
	- Option two
		- start from assignment 2
		- strip down to ex1

* Repo
	- Dockerfile
		- that does... what? (adjust ex1 Dockerfile)
	- 'tests' directory with 'assn3_tests.py'
		- 8 tests are required (p. 10 & 11 in the description)
	- CI by push event
		- Workflow
		- build job: builds and saves the image as a GitHub artifact (or put dockerhub)
			- starts generating 'log.txt': 
				- log the start time&date (according to specified format)
				- log submission names (hardcode)
				- 'image successfully build' / 'image not able to be built' (test both?)
				- save the image as an artifact in GitHub
		- test job: uses created image and runs tests using PyTest
			- save to 'log.txt'
				- 'Container up and running' / 'Container failed to run'
				- 'tests succeeded' / 'test failed' (single test fails -> fail)
			- save 'assn3_test_results.txt'
				- save the file as an artifact, even if an error occured (try.. except block)
		- query job (integration test?): use the service & save output
			- reads a file 'query.txt' (will be uploaded by the tester)
			- creates a new file 'response.txt'
	- Give permission to the tester
